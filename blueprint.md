# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the structure, features, and development history of the Flutter application.

## Current Status

The application is currently in the initial setup phase. The basic Flutter project has been created, but it was not running due to a misconfigured development environment.

## Implemented Features

*   Initial Flutter project structure.

## Style and Design

*   Default Flutter theme.

## Development History

### Initial Troubleshooting

*   **Problem:** The application was not running, and the browser showed a "server IP address could not be found" error.
*   **Investigation:**
    *   Ran `flutter doctor` and identified that the Chrome executable was not found and that several required packages were missing from the environment.
    *   Examined the `.idx/dev.nix` file and confirmed that the necessary packages for web development were not included.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   Updated the `.idx/dev.nix` file to include `chromium`, `clang`, `cmake`, `ninja`, and `pkg-config`.
    *   Instructed the user to restart the workspace to apply the environment changes.
